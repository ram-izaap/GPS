     <h3>Here’s My GPS ™ and 911GPS.me PRIVACY POLICY AND TERMS AND CONDITIONS</h3> <br />

     <b class="b">THE SHORT (Unofficial) VERSION</b>

     <p>
       <b class="b red">1. Do not trust your life to an app, compass, paper map or any other single tool!</b>
       Any GPS app or stand alone GPS device is only as good as the device Operating System, Cell Towers, Satellites and Location Services systems that provide the position information.  Here’s My GPS and 911GPS are just tools, and like any tool in any survival situation, it could possibly fail.  If you planning on putting yourself in a situation where your life could be endangered you need to have multiple back up systems in place but most importantly you need to have the training on how to use them.  If you use the HMGPS system you agree to hold the company harmless if the app, your phone or any of the service providers are unable to provide usable location based information.
     </p>

     <p>
       <b class="b red">2. Live Map Channels are Live Websitess so treat your HMGPS account like any live social media account.  </b>
       The beauty of the HMGPS system is that it divides live map channels into live websites.  Your app and the entire HMGPS system is actually a mini website generator, therefore, your Map Channels are published to the internet and are accessible to anyone who has access to the internet including both the people you have friended or possibly even strangers, just like any Social Media Site.   This makes using the HMGPS system easy for people that do not have any special software or application installed on their devices to view your maps.  While we provide multiple ways for you to limit your exposure to unwanted viewers seeing your location and contact information, you must assume that any system could possibly be hacked and the best way to not share your location is to turn off location based services for all services including Google Maps when HMGPS is not in use.  For Guest users of the HMGPS or 91GPS app or website, none of your contact information or photo is captured and therefore can not be shared.  For HMGPS users that have created an account, your contact information and photo are displayed by default. If you don't want your contact information or photo shared you can unselect those fields in the profile screen of HMGPS application or log out of your account and just use the guest default login.  
     </p>

     <p>
       <b class="b red">3. Your Saftey and Privacy are of Paramount Importance to us. We do not ever Sell or Share your location or contact information to third parties for any marketing purposes.  </b>
       We will use your contact information internally to let you if there is a problem or if we have new services and updates to tell you about.  If contacted by emergency services we may share your location information for search and rescue but this will be handled on a case by case basis by a live person and never an automated system and only in life and death situations.  If you are sharing your contact information in the HMGPS system, in either the Status Pop Up or Clue place-markers on live maps, then that information can be manually collected by a third party, one user at a time, and as you know, even password protection is only a speed bump for a persistent hacker.   The HMGPS system has never been hacked but you have to assume that it will be at some time.  If you don't want your information shared then do not enter it into the HMGPS system or any other contact manager that has the potential to be exposed to the internet.  You can still use HMGPS system in the guest mode and enjoy full privacy.  Any credit card information you have entered in to the HMGPS system is handled by our payment gateways and not saved in our system and is NOT accessible by HMGPS administrators.
